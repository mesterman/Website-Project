          <p> If you are considering surrender, we ask that you exhaust all your

          </p>
          <h4>Surrendering Process:</h4>
          <p>
           <h4> Step 1: Contact us to discuss Surrendering </h4>
            Owners need to fill out an online Pet Owner Surrender Application.
            Once we've recieved your application, we will reach out to discuss your pet's behavior
            and health history and ask questions regarding your pet. Please be prepared to send medical records.
            We will also schedule an in-person evaluation with your dog to further assess his behavior. <br>
            <h4> Step 2: Surrendering Your Pet </h4>
            After reviewing all of the information and in-person evaluation. We will contact you
            on whether or not your pet has been approved to enter our adoption program.
            If approved, we will contact you to schedule an appointment for surrender.
            Please be prepared to pay a surrender fee at the time of the intake to help care for your pet.
            Surrender fees
            - Dog or Cat: $100- $230
            - Rodent: $20
            Surrendering your pet can be stressful for both you and your animal. 
            We encourage that owners bring your pets favorite unwashed toy blanket or bed. <br>
            <h4> Step 3: In the shelter </h4>
            After recieving your pet, all animals will recieve a health and behavior assessment
            to determine their needs in the shelter and in a new home.  <br>
            <h4> Step 4: Adoption </h4>
            If applicable, your pet will be placed for adoption. When a potential adopter is interested in any of our pets
            we'll do a thorough evaluation and spend our time getting to know them before allowing them to take our animals home.
