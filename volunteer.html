          Thank you for your interest in volunteering with Happy Tails Adoption Center! We are thrilled to have your support in fulfilling our mission of saving local at-risk shelter pets. 
          Your time, talent, and experience are invaluable to us. As a growing organization, we are dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming homeless pets, with a focus on at-risk 
          animals at our local San Jose municipal shelter - one of the largest animal shelters in California. We rely on dedicated volunteers like you to help us in every aspect of the organization. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Please note that we are a foster-based organization, which means that the animals we care for live in the private homes of our volunteer foster parents. However, if you are not 
          interested in becoming a foster parent, there are still many volunteer positions available that do not involve hands-on animal experience. 
          <br>
          <br>
          At Happy Tails Adoption Center, we are committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity and inclusion. We recognize that our human capital is our most valuable asset, 
          and we value individual differences,  life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities, and talent that our volunteers and employees bring to our organization.

        <p class="desc3">We welcome students to fulfill various roles in many departments at Happy Tails Adoption Center. Our animal care and enrichment <br> department is where most of our student volunteers thrive, 
          as they assist in creating enrichment toys and tools for our animals, while also helping with laundry and washing dog and cat dishes. For students aged 14 and up, there are also opportunities available in our medical department.
          <br>
          <br>
          As we continue to grow, we are expanding our volunteer roles and opportunities at Happy Tails Adoption Center. If you have a particular interest or skill set that you believe can benefit our organization and falls outside 
          of the categories mentioned above, please email us at abc@example.com. We would love to hear your ideas and see if we can find a way for you to contribute to our mission of saving at-risk <br> shelter pets.
